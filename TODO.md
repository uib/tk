# Improvements for the tk.app.uib.no

Most bugs and ideas for improvements should be recorded by creating an
issue under <https://git.app.uib.no/it/site/tk.app.uib.no/issues>.

We should revise all the descriptions of the GDPR fields based on what
users have problems with. This should also provide links to articles
that describe what/why we ask for this stuff.  This could also be links
directly to the corresponding article in the regulation itself.

We should also provide more explanation about what a "processing" is.

Are there more attributes that we should store about contollers and processors?

What premission regime do we want to enforce. Who is supposed to se what and
who can edit the processing entires. Are there parts of this that can be open
data?
